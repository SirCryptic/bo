# Project Roadmap

### ⚔️ Weapon Images in Camo Tracker
- [❌] Add images for all weapons in the camo tracker.
- [❌] Ensure proper display and scaling of weapon images in the tracker UI.
- [✅] ensure all camo challenges and weapon categories are updated. (Now Includes Season 2 Weapons)

### 🌐 Global Progress
- [➖] Implement global progress tracking for the entire Project BO suite. (Still Needs Work)
- [❌] Enable progress syncing across devices (if applicable, although i highly doubt this will ever be a feature).

### 📝 Finish and Update All Quest Checklists
- [❌] Review all existing quests and checklist items. (not really a priority due to directed mode 🤔)
- [❌] Fix any outdated information in existing checklists.

### 📥 Proper Challenge Naming When Downloading as `.txt`
- [➖] Standardize the naming of challenges when downloaded as `.json`.
- [➖] Add overall progress indicator within `.json` file.
