# Project Roadmap

### ⚔️ Weapon Images in Camo Tracker
- [❌] Add images for all weapons in the camo tracker.
- [❌] Ensure proper display and scaling of weapon images in the tracker UI.
- [❌] ensure all camo challenges and weapon categories are updated.

### 🌐 Global Progress
- [❌] Implement global progress tracking for the entire Project BO suite.
- [❌] Enable progress syncing across devices (if applicable, although i highly doubt this will ever be a feature).

### 📝 Finish and Update All Quest Checklists
- [❌] Review all existing quests and checklist items. (not really a priority due to directed mode 🤔)
- [❌] Fix any outdated information in existing checklists.

### 📥 Proper Challenge Naming When Downloading as `.txt`
- [❌] Standardize the naming of challenges when downloaded as `.txt`.
- [❌] Add overall progress indicator within `.txt` file.
